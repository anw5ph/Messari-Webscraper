# Messari-Webscraper

This project was done during my tenure as a research assistant with Dr. Dennie Kim. 

I designed a webscraper for dynamic web3 applications using Selenium and Python to read through the Messari.io website and pull data regarding all of the Decentralized
Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) that had been registered through Messari, as well as, the tools that each DAO used on a daily basis. 

This information was then organized and exported into an Excel sheet where we were able to group similar types of DAOs and use this information to determine which DAOs to
conduct further research on.
